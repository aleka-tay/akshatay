# AkshaTay Budget WebApp  

**AkshaTay** is a simple and fun budgeting web app. The name comes from my language, where **"Aksha" means "money"**, and **"Tay" is a cute suffix**.  

This app is built using **Ruby on Rails** for the backend and **HTML with Bootstrap** for the frontend. I chose Bootstrap to ensure an **easy-to-use and accessible layout**.  

## Features  
 Each user has their own account  
 Users can create categories for expenses  
 Users can add expenses under categories  
 Users can delete their account  

More features are coming soon!
